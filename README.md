A webpage that shows bar charts for monthly expenses/earnings recorded in an Excel file.

The file must contain a sheet named "Transactions", with the following columns: Date, Details, Money In, Expenses, Currency, Type.

The path to the file should be specified in an environment variable (a `.env` file can be used for this - see `template.env`).

Mostly for personal use (may be updated anytime with breaking/weird changes). Open sourced because why not.
